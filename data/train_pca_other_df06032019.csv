455,4szphe,mivacationthrowaway,1468597325.0,True,t3_4szphe,"Yesterday when I was on the freeway in the middle lane a Detroit police officer was merging onto the freeway from the right, and went straight for my lane and almost hit me. I had to swerve into the passing lane and he continued to swerve and speed with no emergency lights. I have a dash cam on always so this was caught on video, which I'm hoping means there is a visible plate number.

When I got to the left lane I slowed a bit to let him pass but he also slowed to get next to me and stare me down as if *I* were in the wrong, which made me fear he'd pull me over. Unfortunately the camera didn't catch that because it wasn't pointed at my passenger window. Part of me wonders if he saw I was a young white woman and/or my camera and decided not to harass me, because he definitely noticed my vehicle after the fact and had an angry expression on his face before speeding away. Then I saw police lights a few miles up just off the exit with someone pulled over, but I'm not sure if it was him.

I don't frequent here too much but I was thinking some of you might have some experience with this sort of thing. **Is there a way to make a report with video anonymously?** I have real worry that making complaints against the police will bring trouble to my life. At the same time, I hate the idea of perpetuating a culture where we don't speak out against police wrongdoing because of the fear. I've recorded several incidents of police not following all the rules--no turn signal and such--but this incident angered me enough to want to report since he not only almost caused a high-speed accident, but I felt intimidated by his behavior afterward.

I know it's entirely possible that nothing will come of it for the cop, but certainly nothing can happen if no report is made. I know this sub is for the public shaming route but with the shit that keeps happening that's clearly not enough.

I can't upload the video at the moment but I'm using this old throwaway I didn't end up needing because I don't want it associated with my reddit account.

**Edit with link to video:** Not sure if anyone will even see this post since there was a moderation snag when I posted yesterday, but I just uploaded the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6VLMBAjdd0",Is it worth it to report a cop for reckless driving?

1016,4b93tl,copwatch_throwaway,1458505255.0,True,t3_4b93tl,"I am calling for help piecing together information in an off duty officer involved shooting taking place last week in Apple Valley CA that resulted in the death of Vincent Avila Jr, a former playmate and classmate of mine throughout middle school and high school. In this scenario however, he is the accused. 

[From the victim's family:](http://katrina146.wix.com/justiceformybrother)

>KTLA and the Los Angeles Times report that the off duty officer, Shawn Michels, reported to detectives that he awoke to my brother INSIDE his home and ARMED trying to steal his property. Michels (approximately 5’ 10’’ and 185 lbs) further claimed that he then subdued my brother (5’ 5’’ and 135 lbs) and had him at gunpoint. He claims that my brother had ignored his orders to hold his hands up and lie down on the ground and instead had reached for his waistband. Michels then said he opened fire on my brother as a consequence of my brother reaching for his waistband. 

The only problem with Michels claims however is eyewitness accounts from neighbor put's both Avila and Michels outside the home as well as the dispatch audio. Family told by police initially he was not inside the home. Pictures of the investigation show yellow tape marking specific areas outside the home, and family members say Avila's blood covered the rocks OUTSIDE near the street. 

The initial report said one shot and then in the hours proceeding becomes 2, then 3. The officer claims the last and fatal shot was a consequence to not obeying orders to show his hands but with two shots fired before it's easy to speculate ""suspect"" was naturally grabbing at his wounds. Neighbor places the shots around 5 minutes apart.

Vincent Avila was a kind person. Small framed, goofy, and playful. Him and his twin brother were always friendly and moved throughout every group in our schools as so many could get along with these relaxed, nice, and funny guys. After high school I saw he was doing very well for himself in life and as recently as a few days before his death posted yet ANOTHER award he received from his work. It wasn't unusual for Vincent to brag about his accolade and significant raises. When I heard the news of his death I immediately thought of this. My stomach sank and I knew something wasn't right.

I started doing some research and noticed right off the bat the news stories didn't add up. Some saying he was caught inside. Some saying the officer woke up when he noticed things missing. Some saying officer saw suspicious person outside. And another saying the off duty officer saw him outside pushing away his motorcycle. 
Regardless of what is actually the case here- all four of these scenarios can not be true together. And it seems from the neighbor accounts and dispatch audio this ""suspect"" was after the officers motorcycle....but for whatever reason had decided to park his own scooter right behind it.

The community is wanting answers. Vincent was a person who was generous, honest, and kind. A stranger had even reached out the day of this tragedy to share a screen shot of Vincent returning her lost debit card after hunting her down on Facebook the day of his death.In another occasion Vincent returned someones lost cell on the other side of town. The vouch of character to go on for days and no one is buying that this person is capable of what he is being so wrongfully accused of today. Especially in light of the inconsistency in these reports. 

I've shared a few links with more information. Please no trolling. I am desperately asking for help and or any information on the Fontana officer. Anything that can shed light on this ever changing case would be so appreciated.

1149,5j2jmi,jimmyjazz2000,1482097239.0,True,t3_5j2jmi,"I was at the movies in my hometown last night. (Rogue One is great, go see it.) Went to a large multiplex, and it was very crowded. The only exit there is a big set of stairs and escalators. On the way out, I noticed two cops had stationed themselves at the top of the stairs, very high profile. They were watching everybody leave. And two things about their demeanor really, really bothered me:

1. They were dressed for war, looked basically indistinguishable from soldiers in Iraq. Same body armor and gear, etc.

2. They were hard-staring everyone. There's no other way to put it: it felt menacing. Again, the parallel to American soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan leapt to mind. They seemed to be scanning the crowd for potential threats, trouble makers, etc.

This combination really, really bothered me. There was no way to avoid it; you had to go down the stairs and get visually frisked by these glaring, hard-ass military police. I didn't feel protected and served. I felt like a civilian under the watch of an occupying force.

I considered walking over to the officers and asking them to tone down the downtown Fallujah/Checkpoint Charlie vibe. But I didn't want to poke the bear, so I just averted my gaze and walked down the stairs, under surveillance.

How can we get the police to do their jobs without menacing the people they're protecting?

Disclaimer: The information contained in this document is merely one person's viewpoint. None of this information has been legally established as fact.

          On May 29, 2016 John Mark Coffey was shot and killed by 8 police officers in the Burger King parking lot in Clinton, North Carolina. Some have estimated that he may have been shot in excess of 200 times. That same day The Clinton Police Department released a statement (see page 3) regarding the shooting. However, it appears as if they were unaware at that time that a cell phone video of the shooting exists. You can watch the video on YouTube. Here's a link to the cell phone video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPvi5V2UZKE

The following day on May 30, 2016 The Clinton Police Department released another statement (see pages 4 and 5) with some notable changes. In the first press release they said the male subject pointed “the shotgun” at them. Also they failed to mention the fact that he opened the driver's door. In the second press release they said that the male subject opened the driver's door and pointed “a weapon” at them. Note how they went from “the shotgun” to “a weapon”. A shotgun is long and it's hard to believe that someone pointed a shotgun while sitting in the cab of a pickup. The term “a weapon” is more vague and affords the officers more leeway in explaining why they opened fire. It appears that they changed their story in an attempt to make it fit the video. It seems as though the first statement was released before the cell phone video went public and the second statement was released after the police became aware of the video. Those 2 press releases have since been removed from The Clinton Police Department Facebook Page by the way. 
          In the video you can clearly see that Trooper Louis M. High Jr. of The North Carolina State Highway Patrol fired the first of countless rounds which were fired during the incident. He is standing on the right side of the video toward College Street. He shoots with his left hand. He fires 3 rounds and his gun jams. He then backs away and returns with a different gun. He fires all the bullets from that gun, reloads, fires all the bullets from the gun again, reloads again, then walks up closer to John Coffey's truck and fires what seems to be approximately 8 more rounds. And there were 7 other officers shooting as well. Note too that when Trooper High fires the first round you can see the driver's side door of John Coffey's pickup move as if it was hit by that first round meaning that Trooper High shot through the driver's door (or window) therefore the door was blocking his line of sight. You can also see bullets hitting the driver's side window of John Coffey's pickup which means the window was rolled up. Also, when the first shot is fired look through John Coffey's windshield and you can see him slump over as if he was hit by the first round. But you never see any ""weapon"" fall on the pavement below the driver's door of his pickup. It could be argued that the ""weapon"" he supposedly pointed at the officers fell inside the truck but if he pointed this supposed “weapon” out the door there is at least some possibility that he would have dropped it on the pavement when he was hit by the first round.

It's also worth mentioning that Trooper High shot and killed another man named Jason Lee Evans on April 12, 2015. At that time he was a deputy with The Sampson County Sheriff's Department.  Here are the links to 2 different articles giving 2 different explanations of why Jason Evans was shot. One article says he had a gun pointed at his own head, the other article says he pointed a gun at Trooper (then Deputy) High:

http://clintonnc.com/news/827/deputy-justified-in-shooting

http://abc11.com/news/sampson-county-sheriffs-deputy-shoots-and-kills-robbery-suspect/654777/

http://clintonnc.com/news/3449/a-tradition-of-service

          Please note that in the second press release (see page 5) the Clinton Police Department did not use Trooper High's complete name. In every article I've been able to find which was written before John Coffey was killed Trooper High's complete name was given (Louis M. High Jr.). But in every article I've been able to find regarding The John Coffey Shooting Trooper High's name was given as M. High. Could they have been trying to hide the fact that he was involved in both shootings?

          After The North Carolina Chief Medical Examiner released the autopsy report John Coffey's widow spoke to The Sampson Independent Newspaper in Clinton and she says The Medical Examiner is lying. Here's the link to the article:

http://clintonnc.com/news/12045/wife-suicidal-statements-bunch-of-lies

          One thing I can't help noticing about this whole situation is the apparent secrecy. It's amazing just how little information there is available about this shooting. There's nothing about whether his body was cremated or not for example. There's no picture of him. Hardly any information at all. His obituary isn't even on The local newspaper.
          And then there's the new dash cam and body cam law, HB 972. The Judiciary Committee of The North Carolina House Of Representatives passed that bill somewhere around 9 days after John Coffey was killed. That seems to be an awfully strange coincidence. It seems possible that HB 972 may have been specifically designed to prevent the public from viewing the dash cam and body cam footage of The John Coffey Killing. We have the cell phone video which shows plenty. But it seems possible that there may be something on the dash cam and/or body cam videos which shows in greater detail what really happened and that may be why they don't want the public to see it. Could it be that those videos contradict what the police are saying?

Besides updating this case...

I'd really like to know people's thoughts on something. Do you think officers who abuse power/use excessive force can be rehabilited to not do so through more extensive training (both physical and psychological)?

Also, from what I understand, the PD was against reinstatement in this particular case and were actually taken to court (by arbitrators acting on behalf of Flores' police union). Do you think unions should be able to challenge the PD's assessment when it comes to cases that have resulted in a fatal police shooting or excessive force?

2035,54ddzp,jayaffect,1474771566.0,True,t3_54ddzp,"Problem Number 1) Every time an innocent, unarmed black man is killed in the streets Black Lives Matter immediately starts calling it racist, and accusing the cops of being racist. The protests, signs, and chants are all about how black lives matter, and the police should not be targeting black people and killing them at a higher rate than any other race. They essentially say ""You only killed him because he was black."" This leaves the police to simply have to say, ""No, it wasn't because he was black."" And because you could never objectively prove the officer was racist, case closed, no racism proved, nothing was wrong. They are completely missing the point, and giving the police an easy way out. Are you really trying to tell me that if innocent black men were killed at a consistent rate as white people that would be okay? That if Rice, Brown, Garner and Scott was just Garner then nothing would be wrong with it??? That is ridiculous. The problem isn't that police are targeting black people, the problem is that police are killing innocent civilians. The police ARE targeting black people, and that IS a problem, but it isn't THE problem. If police were handing out speeding tickets twice as much to black people then targeting would be the problem, but the police are murdering innocent civilians in cold blood, how they chose to target these innocent civilians is irrelevant compared to the crime they have committed. Why has an innocent black man being killed by the police become ""prove it wasn't because he was black and it's okay?""

Problem number 2) You cannot be equal with a party that does not want to be equal to you. Police have no interest in being equal to black people, so the best black people are going to get is a compromise that is not in their favour. For example, Michael Slager was arrested and charged for murdering Walter Scott, as a result, Slager and his family have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations and are collecting monthly cheques from tax payer dollars while he sits at home, with his family. And black people call that a win? Well I would sure hate to see what a loss looks like if that's what you call a win. If black lives matters is going to accomplish anything they need to take action, and stop hoping the oppressors will decide to stop oppressing. 

I'll tell you this, if white people were being targeted by a group of black people and ruthlessly being murdered on the streets for no reason there would be a hell of a lot more going on than someone kneeling at a football game. Muslims tried to kill us on 9/11, how are they doing 15 years later? The Japanese tried to kill us at pearl Harbour, hows Hiroshima doing these days? And white police officers have killed more innocent civilians than Japanese and Muslim attackers put together since and including those events.

Because if you have guns in a bedroom, you must be a cop killer and have other cop killers hidden in the house.

You never know when the cops may drop by on an ""anonymous"" tip, and find yourself detained on the side walk like my mother was.

Be warned. Placentia Police willing to use deadly force to investigate the very serious issue of alleged building code violations like a garage conversion. It's life or death, people!

I asked for the dash cam and body cam for evidence because he basically used his position as a police officer to make himself look good, I am a professional, 47yo woman who is a member of my community and absolutely believes in following the law.  I requested proof of what happened, back up to what the officer was saying, and lying about, I might add. His lies, and what really happened, two completely different things.  What freaking police department does NOT have dash or body cams...King City Police in Oregon, that's who. 

Officer made me remove my glasses for everything, I'm freaking blind and off balance at a -8.75 WITH cataracts in BOTH eyes.  He said he didn't ask me to remove my glasses, only for the eye test, liar.  He asked me if I had an injury, I told him I had back surgery that I'm still affected by, he states I never told him I had any injuries; He said I was doing 54-55 in the 40, I was going 43; he said I failed all the tests and that was the reason to arrest me...seriously I was blind, had no depth perception and had been up for 22 hours at that point, had I known he didn't have a dash cam or body cam I would have recorded the entire thing and thew it back in his face.  

So awesome to know the police are liars, oh I see everyone complaining on tv, and my thought is, ""well you shouldn't be breaking the law and you wouldn't be in that position.""  I went a bit over the dotted line on a left turn, really?!  The only thing they are protecting and serving is themselves and making sure they get their quota and ruin peoples lives.  Go to hell, he knows who he is, how you can wake each day without guilt is beyond me.  How you can kiss your wife, kids and Mom with that mouth as dirty as it is, is beyond me.

Thеrе аrе mаnу techniques thаt mау bе applied bу thе law enforcement agencies during thе interrogation оf a suspect. Onе оf thе mоѕt popular interrogation techniques iѕ knоwn аѕ thе ""Good cop, Bad cop"" questioning method. Thiѕ technique iѕ knоwn tо bе effective bесаuѕе it manipulates thе suspect's perception оf thе interrogators. In ѕuсh a scenario, оnе оf thе detectives iѕ presented аѕ angry, extremely hostile аnd aggressive. Whilе thе оthеr iѕ contrastingly calm, empathetic аnd presents himѕеlf аѕ understanding tоwаrdѕ thе suspect. 
 
It iѕ thе ""bad cop"" thаt begins thе interrogation. Hе соmеѕ оff аѕ vеrу unpleasant аnd еvеn threatening. Thе role оf thе ""bad cop"" iѕ tо accuse thе suspect withоut leaving аnу chance tо thе person tо offer explanation оr alibi. In addition thе detective playing ѕuсh a role mау bе borderline verbally abusive аnd uncontrolled. In сеrtаin countries, a ""bad cop"" will еvеn uѕе extreme interrogation methods, ѕuсh аѕ torture. 
 
Pushing thе suspect tо thе state оf despair, thе ""bad cop"" will thеn bе tamed bу thе ""good cop"". Thеу might еvеn argue in front оf thе suspect, tо show hоw differently thеу feel аbоut thе suspect`s involvement in a givеn crime. Of соurѕе thiѕ iѕ аll раrt оf thе drill, thаt iѕ meant tо show thе suspect thаt оnе оf thе detectives саn bе trusted. Thе ""bad cop"" will thеn bе asked tо leave thе interrogation room. 
 
Aftеr thе ""bad cop"" leaves thе room, thе mоѕt crucial раrt оf thе interrogation begins. In fact thеrе аrе twо роѕѕiblе tactics a ""good cop"" саn use. Thе first, involves bеing extremely apologetic tо thе behavior оf thе оthеr ""bad cop"". Thе ""good cop"" will show sympathy tоwаrdѕ thе suspect аnd psychologically present himѕеlf аѕ thе suspect`s friend, rаthеr thаn аn investigator. 
 
At thаt point hе mау offer thе suspect ѕоmеthing tо drink оr a cigarette, tо show furthеr kindness. Suсh аn attitude will put thе suspect аt ease, whеrе he/she will feel likе thеу оwе it tо thе ""good cop"" tо confess аbоut thе crimes оr offer аnу information previously withheld. 
 
If thiѕ method fails, thе ""good cop"" will thеn explain tо thе suspect thаt hе might nоt bе аblе tо tame hiѕ partner оnсе hе соmеѕ back tо thе room, аnd will bе unable tо kеер thе suspect оut оf harm`s way. Thе оnlу bargain fоr thе suspect`s safety bесоmеѕ аnу information thаt thе suspect mау рrоvidе tо hеlр advance thе investigation. 
 
Thiѕ method iѕ knоwn аѕ thе hurt аnd rescue principle. Thiѕ principle iѕ illustrated bу thе ""bad cop"" psychologically hurting thе suspect, whilе thе ""good cop"" соmеѕ tо hiѕ rescue. 
 
Thiѕ creates dynamics оf exchange аnd unconsciously binds thе suspect tоwаrdѕ cooperating with thе ""rescuer"". Thе suspect iѕ put in a position whеrе he/she feels obligated tо show gratitude tо thе ""savior"" bу volunteering information thаt оthеrwiѕе wоuld hаvе bееn kерt secret. 
 
Hоwеvеr thiѕ technique will nоt work with аll suspects. In fact, it iѕ mоѕtlу effective оn young оr firѕt timе offenders. Individuals thаt hаvе bееn arrested аnd interrogated previously, аrе nоt аѕ easily manipulated bу thiѕ technique аѕ thеу hаvе ѕееn thiѕ approach in thе past. 
 
In mоѕt cases thеу will simply request a lawyer, preventing thе detectives frоm аѕking аnу mоrе questions. Law enforcement field requires frоm itѕ staff fаr mоrе thаn juѕt a good physical shape, it аlѕо involves a great deal оf acting аnd ""Good cop, Bad Cop"" technique сlеаrlу demonstrates that.

The investigation is ongoing, so we ask the public not to jump to any reckless conclusions.  Seeing as how the suspect was a human being, it is wrong to assume that he was out to hurt or kill people.  He probably just wanted to get home at the end of the day to be with his family.  The entire situation might also be due to improper training.  We would also like to remind the public that the victims made a conscious decision to carry weapons and may have been standing in an intimidating manner.

Also, since this is an ongoing investigation, any information or video evidence should be kept out of the hands of the public and the press because it might interfere with the pursuit of justice.

But what you don't know is that I am only 1 of 3 active mods. The other two being /u/AnnArchist & /u/FreedomsTorch. The others have abandoned this subreddit entirely. So although I may not be top mod, I'm going to try to overhaul this subreddit like I were. And I can only do that with your help.

#Rules

As you can see, in the current sidebar there are no official rules. Just meager guidelines. They are vague and barebones to say the least. This is a recipe for disaster. As has been proven daily with the constant reposts and complaints of lack of quality.

#Automod

I know censorship is a real treat. Sometimes its external and other times internal. Some of you are complaining about your comments [""disappearing"" or being censored.](https://redd.it/4stf12) 99.99% of the time, its our inhouse Automod being overzealous. I'm going to share our Automod ""code"", so that we can refine it together. But to do so, we first need to lay the ground works in our rules.

##Present AM settings.

1. Auto remove any comment with links to /r/ProtectAndServe.
2. Auto remove any post from imgur.
3. Auto remove links from spammers & spam sites.
1. Auto remove any comment or links from brand new users.
2. Auto remove any comment with slurs, racist, curses & death threats.


#Flairs

Right now we have 4 types of link flairs, Repost, Raw Video, News Report & Personal Experience. I don't think thats enough. We can expand on them as well. As well as making it mandatory for all links to have a link flair for better organization. Lets brainstorm some ideas.

#Sidebar & Wiki

Our sidebar & wiki are older than time itself. They are going to get updating. Give your 2 cents on how to make it better. If you'd like to update our wiki, please mention so, we can can give you permissions to do so.

#CSS

Personally I don't feel we need a CSS overhaul. It excels at what it's suppose to do. But if there are any suggestions regarding that, this is the place to do it.

#Edits

I'm one of those people who always forgets something. So be sure to come back to this post to see any updated that I add at a later time. Also, if I see a good suggestion I like to implement it immediately.

#Community Feedback

Now is the perfect chance for you, the community, to give me a piece of your mind. Be it a suggestion, thought, idea, constructive criticism, something I should add, something I should change, something I should not add or remove. Now is the time. In the past I have always given user opinions a fair shake and today is no different. So speak up, let your voice be heard. 

Do so in a civilized manner.

These updates are to show transparency on my part. I'm mentioning everything I do so you, the community know, what I am doing and why I'm doing it.

#New Rules

There are some new rules we put into place. They are located in the sidebar for easy viewing. If you can't see the sidebar, you can find them [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/about/rules/) Here is the link to our [Rules Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules) with an expanded explanation for everything.

Hopefully with these 5 simple to understand rules we can get back on track to being a better subreddit. Now that these rules are in place. Trolls, your days are numbered. If you see a troll, summon me directly via my username `/u/jaxspider` and I will perma-ban the troll on site.

#Moderation

Right now, I'm simply notifying posters if they break a rule. They can make a new post with the suggestions I mention to them. No disciplinary action will taken.

It will look like this...

`/u/USERNAME` **Removed** 1. [Properly title & format your post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_proper_formatting_your_titles.)

Here is the most recent time I [used it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/4th41e/cleveland_police_union_head_obama_has_blood_on/d5hc5id)

Starting next week, on July 25^th 2016

Two day temp ban(s) will be given for breaking rule #1, #3, #4 & #5.

Rule #2 will be addressed on a case by case scenario. 

**[EDIT]** For clarification sake, Rule #2 will be in effect started immediately. 


#New Link Flairs

I've updated the flairs as well. Here is the wiki on [Link Flairs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules)

Just a reminder, your post will be auto removed by /u/flair_your_post_bot if you do not manually select a link flair after you post. Once you select your flair, the bot will auto re-approve your post without any hassle.

#Fear Of Censorship

There should be no fear of censorship. I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech. You can speak your mind here. Just be respectful of your colleagues and the rules we put in place. The main objective of this subreddit is to hold police accountable for their actions. That will never change.

#Community Feedback

Once again, now is the perfect chance for you, the community, to give me a piece of your mind. Be it a suggestion, thought, idea, constructive criticism, something I should add, something I should change, something I should not add or remove. Now is the time. In the past I have always given user opinions a fair shake and today is no different. So speak up, let your voice be heard.

I believe there is some confusion on what lawful means in terms of a ""lawful order."" Lawful does not mean an order that does not break the law. If that were the case, there would be an almost endless list of orders that a cop could give that don't break any laws. A cop could tell you to paint your house red. A cop could tell you to wear dresses.

It means an order that has some authority behind it. There has to be a law that allows the cop to give you the order.  A cop can only give you an order to paint your house red, if in fact there is a law that specifically states that the police are allowed to give you that order.

Our single car driveway is not long enough for two cars to fit in it, without hanging over the sidewalk. I have lived at this address for 9 years. I've parked my car like this for 9 years. I have never been ticketed until this morning. 

In the past I've parked out on the street at a curb that exists between mine and my neighbors driveway, in the event we have company. My neighbors also do this from time to time. We normally pull our cars to the curb with the front bumper. I've been ticketed twice for doing that as well. They say it's only legal to park at the curb with the passenger side to the curb. However if I did that, I'd block not only my driveway but my neighbors driveway as well. 

I was so livid this morning I decided to message the local PD on Facebook and ask them exactly how and where they would like me to park legally. Their was response was that they have to enforce all municipal codes and since my car was blocking the sidewalk it's a violation and could people walking in danger... 

They also claimed that they only issue violations for something like this if someone complains. Bullshit... The ticket was written at 2am. No one complained at 2am. The only time they ticket is when they drive through early morning hours just looking for shit like this.

Five of my neighbors were ticket as well.

4117,48i1m8,CaspianX2,1456859161.0,True,t3_48i1m8,"I've seen this sentiment expressed a few times on here recently. Basically, the gist of the argument is that, since people don't seem outraged at the was overbearing cops infringe on our liberties and harm (or kill) innocent citizens, that our best hope for real reform is that people will get fed up with the costs incurred by these actions from lawsuits won by the victims.

While this may seem like a cynical way to view the topic, in truth it's not cynical enough, because we've already seen how this sort of thing is handled by other professions.

Picture this - You have doctors getting drunk on the job, being lazy, or just plain sucking at their job, and as a result, they make mistakes. Terrible mistakes. Life-changing mistakes. Fatal mistakes. Those affected sue the doctor and hospital, and if they're not stuck with a judge who has a bias in favor of the hospital and its staff, maybe they win.

But like the cops, the doctors aren't directly affected by these lawsuits. They have insurance. Insurance covers the costs of these lawsuits, and the doctors often go right back to work, still often continuing to fuck up their patients and making more potential lawsuits. Meanwhile, the insurance company adjusts their rates to cover their expenses, and those costs are passed on to the hospitals, who in turn pass it on to patients.

Sound familiar? This is much like those cops causing expenses for taxpayers, isn't it? So, did taxpayers revolt at these shitty doctors causing increased medical costs?

Ha, no.

Instead, this created a movement for ""tort reform"", blaming these increased costs on ""frivolous lawsuits"", usually along with the claim that they ""only benefit greedy personal injury lawyers"". This reform was needed to stop these frivolous lawsuits, it was claimed. And often in many states, such legislation was passed, both limiting victims' ability to sue, and limiting how much they could be awarded if they won a lawsuit.

So the result of shitty doctors causing horrible medical problems that resulted in expensive lawsuits was that new laws were passed to protect those doctors from lawsuits so that people wouldn't have to pay for their mistakes. Instead of, you know, changing policies to catch and punish the shitty doctors.

So here's where it pertains to this subreddit - if people passed these sorts of laws to protect shitty doctors, why do you think they won't pass them to protect shitty police? If a police department's costs truly get to be terribly egregious, it'll very likely just get sold to the public as being caused by ""frivolous lawsuits"" needing ""tort reform"", with the end result not being the expulsion of the bad cops or new policies to restrict their power, but instead restrictions on victims' rights to sue for what cops do to them, and limits on how much they can get out of such lawsuits.

In short, don't depend on greed to be the factor that stops this from happening. It won't. If we are to have any hope of changing this, it is through people seeing how those affected are innocents, how they too can be affected, and how truly atrocious these acts are.","Why ""eventually taxpayers will object to cops because of the cost of lawsuits"" is a faulty argument.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/48i1m8/why_eventually_taxpayers_will_object_to_cops/,2qqdb,0,2016-03-01 19:06:01,2016-03-01,19,reddit,0,-0.054904917845922045,-0.017099475919410443,-0.01845711122666966,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

4479,4gjiy1,RSJW404,1461686974.0,True,t3_4gjiy1,"I sat down with my wife and went through the incident step by step.
My wife was home with our three kids last Thursday afternoon, I was at work. At one point, the two younger kids came tearing in, while mom was in the bathroom. They said the neighbor was in our yard cutting down our blackberry bushes (Blackberry bushes that we received on our wedding day).
Now, a week prior to this incident, my wife had stopped in at the clerks office in the Justice Center to swear out a complaint about our neighbor threatening to kill our kids and dogs. Clerk calls District attorney and he says they can't do anything the first time, but if he does it again, they can get him on 'terroristic threats'. Great.
With this in mind, my wife arms herself with her .380 S&W Bodyguard, runs out barefoot to the blackberry patch. Neighbor had been across the property line and cut down our blackberries with a 16"" hand scythe and a metal rake. When my wife approached and asked him what he was doing, he began screaming obscenities and advancing on my wife. She responded by raising her weapon and telling him to get off our property, back off, back off, back off! Neighbor stopped and he retreated. My wife retreated and called 911 while neighbor continues to scream obscenities as she tries to speak to the 911 operator.
After being assured help was on the way, she called me and I stayed on the phone until I heard the sirens. However, before the law arrived, the neighbor became again, approached the line and told my wife he was going to 'destroy' her and looked my son right in the eye and told him that he and his dog was going to die tonight. This was the second time my wife raised her weapon and backed him off. When the neighbor did, her weapon came down.

My wife's weapon had a full magazine, an empty chamber, safety on, and her finger never left the side of the trigger guard. She successfully de-escalated a bad situation twice. This was a text book example of the use of force and the de-escalation of force.

When law enforcement arrived in three vehicles, two deputy cars around our house while the two detectives drove down to neighbors house. After about 15 minutes, they returned and said there was a tape and that she was to be arrested for two counts of aggressive assault. Wife asked if they wanted to look at our video evidence, they refused, she asked what about what the DA told us? Deputy said 'If you keep talking, you're going to have more charges', 'In the State of Tennessee, there is no law about 'terroristic threats', then the detective chimed in with James 1:19 'Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger' as she was cuffed in front of her children and taken to jail.
When I found out she was being arrested, I dropped everything and drove to the Justice Center to arrange bail. Yeah right, I don't know the procedure. Google. Success. I get there and they say the Judge hasn't sent anything over yet so I waited. 90 minutes later, Judge says No and one of the conditions of her bond would be I'd have to remove any weapons from the house. In the mountains of the Cherokee National Forest. Home of Lions, Tigers, and Bears. 
I go back at 8:30am the next day, told it might be after lunch. I'm wtf'ing. Go home and get a call from my wife at 12:40PM. I get her out at 2:40PM. They hurt her. The haunted look in her eyes tells me it's bad. She's never had any priors, yet was humiliated in front of our children and publicly.

And she did everything right.

5022,44bltc,AIFTG,1454690451.0,True,t3_44bltc,"Hey everyone,

Ever watch a video on this sub where a cop arrests someone for a charge that seems like total abuse of power? Or read an article where a cop made a ""lawful demand"" for someone to stop recording? How about when a cop demands to see I.D and you are not sure if your state is a Stop and Identify state? Ever been curious about the legality of situations like these? Well, I've been researching a ton of case, federal and state laws for the past 7 months and I've been linking everything I've come across in a Wiki.

So when we see a cop say: ""It's illegal to film me"". Well [here are case laws that supports filming police](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/filmingpolice). If you are curious what [Obstruction of Justice](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/obstruction_of_justice) is, or the laws about [Checkpoints](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/checkpoints) or [Traffic Stops](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/trafficstops). I've been putting all these laws into [one central location](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index) that's easy to digest and find. 

When a cop in Arizona says they will arrest someone for [Disorderly Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/disorderly_conduct) and you want to know [Arizona's criminal code](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/arizona) for disorderly conduct. Or if [Vermont](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/vermont) has a stop and identify law and what it says. If a NM cop threatens trespassing and you want to know what's [New Mexico's](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/new_mexico) trespassing laws are. I have all [50 states](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/statelist) with their criminal codes linked and all the common charges police love to threaten or arrest people for also linked. I also have laws on [Stop and Identify](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/stopandidentify) and case law helps qualify when police have RAS or not. 

I have plans on making this Wiki massive. From from case law dealing with police encounters, to how to conduct effective 1st amendment tests or laws surrounding using a drone. [Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/comments/43pdmo/welcome_please_take_a_moment_to_read_this_post/) for more info on the Wiki and my plans for it.

First, I'd like to give a slight bit of history, then I will get on to the commercials. **Links to the commercials are below.**

Hey guys! I'm a long-time Redditor, but I'd prefer this not be associated with my personal account.

I am part of a law firm in Louisiana which has a very strong passion for civil rights and has handled many cases against law enforcement agencies. One of the agencies which we have had several cases against, Iberia Parish Sheriff's Office, has had 8 of their deputies plea guilty to federal civil rights violations in the past week or two - and many more are likely to come. In fact, their sheriff just got indicted on federal civil rights charges a few days ago.

**Here's a couple of articles if you'd like to read more** (I'd highly recommend it - very interesting reads, and some of the things these guys have done are atrocious... and this is just what has been admitted!):
http://www.katc.com/story/31309687/new-information-in-federal-case-of-former-iberia-parish-sheriffs-office-employees

http://klfy.com/2016/03/10/doj-indicted-iberia-parish-sheriff-louis-ackal-with-civil-rights-violations/





I believe the majority of these guys who have entered guilty pleas are facing ~10 years - and that's with them agreeing to testify against others. I think the consequences for them would have been much worse had they not agreed to cooperate.

If you'd like to read up on some of our past cases against law enforcement agencies, you can find some of them by Googling ""Clay Burgess Sheriff"", et al.

-------

As mentioned, we are very passionate about civil rights violations. We have handled many civil rights cases for clients, but we also have done a lot of non-commercial work behind the scenes (and have a couple very big of projects in the works) to take a stand against civil rights violations, which I can't yet talk about.


Because of this, we decided to take a very public stand on this issue, and do something which I haven't seen done before - despite the amount of hatred it will bring from certain parties.

We went ahead and had several police brutality commercials produced which we will be promoting online, as well as airing publicly on television.

**I'd like to hear any input or feedback you guys have - positive, negative, whatever** - as well as any ideas you guys have for future projects (whether it be the next batch of commercials we produce, or otherwise) or things you'd do differently.
There certainly will be more upcoming projects - for one example, we'd like to do some kind of weekly civil rights video blog.




**Here are the first 3 brutality commercials which we had produced - we just got these back several weeks ago, and they have not been aired or promoted publicly yet:**



**Police Brutality #1**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c1J7rlzYo8

**Police Brutality #2**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i3b8q3Soic

**Inmate Abuse #1**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK5XHV2LM2c


**Something I thought was pretty cool is that most of the footage in the background of these videos is actual surveillance footage from cases we have handled.**


I hope you guys enjoy... Again, I welcome all comments or input, whether it be positive or negative.



**On a side note, I've also contemplated having Clay do an AMA on the topic of civil rights / brutality once we can release more information about some of the things we have been involved in lately.

5066,4ttnfp,AnnArchist,1469052275.0,True,t3_4ttnfp,"edit: This is a joint statement from both myself and /u/FreedomsTorch 

I'm just going to ask that you don't reply without reading the entire letter. Its going to be long - just read it.

After some extensive conversations in modmail it became abundantly clear during a moderator mail discussion that u/jaxspider had a fundamentally different outlook on how this subreddit should be moderated, both to my vision as well as other moderators. For that reason, among others, he or she is no longer a moderator of this subreddit. We wish them well and hold no grudges. They also did do a lot of good things in this sub.  He was the person doing the CSS - I'm sure many of you may appreciate whats been done here in regards to CSS - thank him for that. 

I have always believed that my job as a moderator of this particular subreddit is to interfere as minimally as possible. Short of direct threats and doxing, I like to leave things up to the users.  The reason the recent rules change went into effect is that none of the rest of us moderators tried to interfere in any substantial fashion. The rules likely came from the best of intentions. They just weren't implemented in a way the rest of the team was comfortable with here.

Our current moderation policy will essentially revert to what was in place a week ago. We will still automatically filter links to the cop subreddit which shall not be named to avoid accusations of brigading and therefore potential quarantine/deletion of the subreddit. We will still filter new accounts to fight spam and manually approve those posts as needed. Unless your meme is certified dank, we'll probably remove it - even then, I'll remove it once I see it to make room for real news. We will leave the option to flair but not require it. Other than that, we plan to continue doing as little as possible. 

The one caveat is that we will be leaving the rules as they are in place on the sidebar with some minor modifications, both for tone as well as content (change from commands to suggestions). But as said earlier, no active moderation is planned, so they will essentially be guidelines instead of rules. We will revisit this down the road, not as a matter of enforcement, but as to whether or not they've added value to the user experience. This isn't an authoritarian subreddit - its the fucking internet. It never has been, never will be - absent my disappearance from here. At which point its because one of the 6 or 7 guys above me removed me OR because something happened to me IRL.

This is your sandbox. Shit in it all you like - I'll try to keep it steered in the right direction as best I can - that said, these ""rules"" are for all of our benefit. I will explain why below. Feel free to disagree, rage, whatever. I don't care. This is the internet - it won't hurt my feelings. I'm just going to explain my thoughts and hopefully you will have taken the time to read, consider and process what I took the time to write to all of you. I fully plan to read all the comments that show up here.

Anyone, I feel like I should give you an explanation of my logic (agree or disagree -  doesn't matter, most of it isn't going to enforced much here anyway  - well no. 1,2 and 5) for these rules.  

#Rule 1 - Please post the date.

This has been something I have wanted for a long fucking time here. Why? Simple: There is no reason for a story from 4 years ago to be the top post in this subreddit.  

There are so many CURRENT police abuses that when those hit the top - and its not an update on the story - it makes the subreddit less useful as a police accountability tool. Just as importantly - for every post that IS on the front page, there is going to be 1 that is bumped off of the front page. Those posts are not going to get near the traffic that our front page posts will receive. If they don't receive traffic, they don't get shared, if they don't get shared, they don't get picked up by national media.... etc etc etc.

This is first and foremost an activist sub. We are doing ourselves AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE VICTIMS OF THE ABUSE an inservice by failing to date the posts. You may say this sounds like hyperbole, I assure you it is not. I explain why below.

If someone sees today's date - they know its current and click-worthy. If someone sees something that looks like something they saw last week - they pass skip over it. Dates will drive more traffic both to this subreddit and to the article in question. It will also makes it more likely that a sub like /r/tldr will pick it up or other subs will take notice because people will see the post and think ""OH HEY A NEW STORY BETTER GET SOME KARMA BY REPOSTING THIS SHIT EVERYWHERE ELSE ON REDDIT.""

By driving traffic to these articles, it begets more articles because the places we drive traffic to will take  notice and in America, news is about the news, its about profits. Part of profits is traffic.

If you really want to be a fuckin rockstar- post the location too. Those 2 pieces of information are on the byline of every news article for reason. They are 2 of the most important pieces of information in every article.

Flair if you like. I don't see a reason to make a moderator just to remove things that aren't wearing their yellow star. It just isn't productive to the goal. So that shit is out. Also - we will not be adding flair for pns posters. Stop asking for that. They don't get a yellow star either. If you want to flair them, get RES already. 


#Rule 2 - Limit the verbal abuse.

Pretty simple really. I changed the verbiage. Why should we limit the verbal abuse? Well, because you guys are a bunch of assholes and I really fucking hate getting reports. This is your sandbox. I'd prefer you guys were civil? Why? Well, it would raise the level of discourse here.
Which comment would you prefer to read?

1) Suck my balls. Fuck you cocksucker.  You PIG BOOT LICKER (I figured I'd copy clips from some of my inbox recently)

2) That officer is likely to receive his full pension despite having been completely out of line. This shooting of 6 year old Juan Howard should not have happened. Until the thin blue line is erased, we can expect more bad cops to be put in a position of power - a position they do not deserve. I feel bad for the citizens of Gofuckyourselfistan. They can't even concealed carry there thanks to overbearing rulesets. (Idk what the fuck I'm writing about, but its still better than reading FUCK THAT PIG SHOULD DIE!)

Personally, I'd rather read something closer to the 2nd. The level of discourse here much of the time recently has declined. We want you guys to step it up. So quit being dicks and just express yourself beyond a 5th grade level. This isn't for all of you, but for the ones that this is directed at - you don't know who you are, but you should. 

Secondly - We do not want this subreddit Quarantined. That would be a complete disaster not only for this sub itself - but for the victims of police abuses everywhere. You may think I'm overstating our relevance - but I'm not.

Why would it be so bad? /r/news, /r/politics, /r/adviceanimals, /r/otherfrontpagesubs - They don't allow stories about police abuses. Keeping us as a part of /r/all (which has been very rare as of late) is vital to our ability to drive traffic to these stories. If these stories don't get traffic - news outlets stop covering them. They stop covering them - you stop seeing them on facebook 3 days after they happen. Then so do your friends. Then everyone stop caring or stops knowing there is a major problem with the police here in America. Simple as that.

Again, there is a profit motive for news outlets. They won't cover these stories if no one can drive traffic to them. Reddit is one of the largest drivers of traffic in America. I think Facebook or Twitter is number 1, but reddit is too high up there to be ignored by any outlet.

#Rule 3 - Fake cop subreddits aren't going to be mentioned here for the same as the reasons above.

1) They bump good posts off the front page.

2) They are unverified and unverifiable.

3) They distract from our agenda - which is to go after real cops. Not people pretending to be the police on the internet.

4) Harassing/doxxing/brigading them could send us the way of an a great sub that I still dearly miss, /r/fatpeoplehate (check out /r/adiposeamigos if you miss it too). We don't want that.

5) Why would you give trolls attention - it only serves to make them grow and to make them appear more often.

This rule will remain enforced. If you can tell me how linking to them will be Verifiable, identifiable without doxxing(stories aren't any good if we don't know when, where, who or how it happened), how these posts won't bump good posts off the front page (they will) and how they don't belong in /r/drama or /r/subredditdrama instead - I am all ears. But if it doesn't meet ALL of that (impossible) criteria - it is FIRMLY off topic/spam. That is not the scope of this subreddit. Yes - I'm (one of) the boss(es), I(we) get to define the scope of the sub. There is unanimous agreement on this one amongst the mods as best I can tell.

Like I said before - This is an activist subreddit - Not some fucking internet /r/drama subreddit. Yes I'm plugging another sub I mod - theres like a 100 of them. Go subscribe. Or unsubscribe. Or go fuck yourself. I don't really care what you do. There are plenty of subs that can be /r/shitfakeinternetcopssay - this just isn't it.

Ok - I've told you where to post that shit- We can move on now.

#Rule 4 - Memes

This is an activist subreddit. Not /r/adviceanimals

##CONGRATS GUYS! YOU DID IT! OUR MEME MADE **BERNIE THE PRESIDENT!**

Posting memes is not activism. If it was /r/sandersforpresident would have been successful. Now their fake activism has resulted in Hilary as the nominee.

Like I said above - every post on the front page bumps another real story off the front page. So fuck off with the memes and fake activism. Post the damned article.

This has been a rule for ages. We've quietly removed front page threads that are just memes for years now. So nothing really will change here.

#Rule 5

Well - I've never enforced this. Probably never will. But it feels really good to have it in writing somewhere since so many of you bitch about it so often. Just get better at voting please. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR PREFERENCES TO ""HIDE VOTED ON"" - THIS WILL MAKE REPOSTS BARELY A PROBLEM.

Now you've read all this I assume. The only thing thats going to get most of you banned here is spam, dox and racism. Those will be mostly permanent. So don't do that shit.

Also - please stop reporting stuff unless its actually spam or a meme.


________________________________________________

Furthermore - here is the automod ruleset we use here currently. If a post is removed by automod - its likely because of this. If that is the case, message us instead of accusing us of being some sort of crazy censorship power hungry mods. 

I know you guys love a witch hunt, but seriously, just stop. You are wrong and you should feel bad. I won't care and will only try to get you worked up for it. 

The only thing I changed on here in the past week was removing the words ""Rape, Raped and Cuck"" because those should've never been on there in the first place. 

If you want to tell someone to fuck off - put a little bit of effort into it first. Thats all this ruleset makes you do. I want to see your most creative insults in the modqueue. . . not some super low effort ""Fuk urself"" - how about something that might cut a little bit deeper with most of our users like ""look dude, we know you're already 45 and balding, but its time you stepped outside, got a job and moved the fuck out of your parents basement"" - I know its not the greatest insult, but its better than 'fuck ursef' and more entertaining for me to reapprove in the modqueue.

Now I was going 70 up the hill and there were people doing the same next to me. Anyways I look in my rear view and sure enough the cop was behind me with his lights on. When he came to my car he said I was going 70 in a 35.i than said I thought the speed limit was 50 and he just said nope it's 35. That's considered reckless driving and he would have taken my car,impounded it and taken me to jail thankfully he didnt... He then told me he wrote the ticket as going 70 in a 50 so what I should have gotten but than I looked at the ticket and he wrote it as going 60 in a 40. That's worse than doing 70 in a 50 considering 20 over in a 40 is 50% of the speed limit over where is like a 1/3rd of the speed limit over or something like that. I know 20 over is still 20 over but the higher the speed limit the less of a danger it really is Can I fight the ticket considering the cops lack of knowledge of the speed limit and considering he wrote the wrong speed to on said ticket. If not he also gave me the option to go to a 3.5 hour defensive driving  school to get it off my record but I figure maybe if I explain the circumstances to the judge I might be able to fight it and than if it doesn't work I can still attend the class",Cop lied about speed limit and wrote it as a different speed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/4xu9ik/cop_lied_about_speed_limit_and_wrote_it_as_a/,2qqdb,0,2016-08-15 16:02:04,2016-08-15,16,reddit,0,-0.054904917845922045,-0.017099475919410443,-0.01845711122666966,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In some ways, I'm aware that it's radical and unlikely to be adopted. Partially because of the implied power dynamic of law enforcement and entrenched traditional imagery, and partially because of what a massive backlash would ensue from officers themselves. 

The proposition: Law Enforcement Officers should be banned from carrying firearms (with lethal payload) on-duty. The risk they accept in taking on such a duty should put others' lives ahead of their own.

1. Law enforcement officers are obliged to ensure due process even to those they suspect to be harboring criminal intent. This means that the sentence of death is something the officer does not carry the authority to deliver.

2. Effective means of protection, incapacitation, and/or subjugation are readily accessible to police in the 21st century. These methods vary from pepper spray to absolute incapacitation and humiliation (TASERs with roughly the effective range of a pistol). These methods not only are effective, they also are less likely to cause fatal escalation due to their non-lethal nature. This would require proof, so this is open for dismissal or affirmation, but consider this: are you more likely to escalate when faced with momentary paralysis or blindness or when faced with death? This is the same principle behind why mountain hikers are encouraged to carry bear spray rather than trying to fatally wound an attacking bear with a gun. If a quarrel is taken here, it need be noted that I'm aware a TASER has a limited range, but have not listed all the alternatives either. There are more, even crossing into non-lethal firearm territory (rubber bullets).

3. Given the availability of these methods of protection, simply pointing a gun at the detained carries the implicit intention to kill. A firearm could kill even by accident or poor marksmanship (all the more likely when dealing with a real situation rather than a shooting range), and therefore the margin of lethal error implies that refusal of alternative methods is the same as admitting the possibility of murder.

4. Therefore, even carrying a gun is treading the line for violation of due process. 

I would put forth further that a liberal may argue the officer would be within rights to carry a gun, as he/she is a subset of the general population and free to do what a citizen can do in addition to any granted power otherwise. However, I would say that while the individual is within the right to own the firearm for off-duty use, he/she should simply not be permitted to carry on-duty for the reasons above. It's a breach of a sort of subset social contract.

At the very least, point 3 should indicate at least that indictment of any officer who kills someone should not be hard. It is not the officer's decision to decide who lives or dies. If the officer kills while having even more abundant non-lethal options for defense than a civilian, it is still murder.

With all this unnecessary killings, i feel like, soon, minorities mainly, will start to just pop shots at cops as soon as they are pulled over.

I mean the statistics from the FBI say, ~60% chance of minorities getting killed by cops even if they dont have a weapon, arent holding anything and fully compliant anyway, so if you're going to get shot and possibly killed anyway, what is stopping them from going all out and attacking police? 
Im unhappy about the poor police work, but i think there is going to be some serious implications to cops around america because of these 2 high profile cases.
its not like there is a lack of weapons in the states anyway.",Question about Bad Cops,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/4rs0jy/question_about_bad_cops/,2qqdb,0,2016-07-08 01:00:55,2016-07-08,01,reddit,0,-0.054904917845922045,-0.017099475919410443,-0.01845711122666966,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ricky Munday is another example of someone doing it right. When you deal with police you are dealing with a known criminal gang. They are 800K strong.

Workers Vanguard No. 1095 9 September 2016

Don’t Kneel for Racist U.S. Imperialism!

At the August 26 preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem. As he defiantly said, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.... There are bodies in the streets and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” A racist, red-white-and-blue backlash was immediate on social media and the bourgeois press. On the other side, there has been an outpouring of support for Kaepernick whose 49ers jersey is now a best seller. Other athletes have expressed solidarity with Kaepernick. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane stayed on the bench when “The Star Spangled Banner” was played before a September 1 game against the Oakland Raiders. Two days later, soccer player Megan Rapinoe refused to stand during the playing of the anthem before her Seattle Reign played the Chicago Red Stars.

The National Football League is a multimillion-dollar business, its players almost 70 percent black. Its owners and executives, who are almost 100 percent white, don’t like anyone stirring up trouble on their sports plantation. Anonymous NFL executives denounced Kaepernick as a “traitor,” with one comparing him to a former NFL player who hired a hit man to murder his pregnant girlfriend! The White House press spokesman weighed in calling Kaepernick’s remarks “objectionable,” while echoing the hypocritical liberal refrain that his supposed freedom to do so is embodied in the blood-drenched flag of American imperialism. President Obama himself later intoned that, while “tough” for cops and the military to stomach, Kaepernick’s protest is “how democracy works.”

The Santa Clara cops who police the 49ers’ stadium warned that Kaepernick’s actions have “threatened our harmonious working relationship” with the team. This was echoed by the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association who threatened, “we will not stand by while he attacks police officers in this country.” As the body count of black people gunned down on the streets by the cops daily mounts, the police are particularly incensed when “uppity” black athletes, musicians and other prominent figures protest these racist atrocities.

There is a long roster of black athletes who have been vilified by the capitalist masters for defying the rituals of the so-called “land of the free.” Among them are those who are now rallying behind Kaepernick. These include Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze winners in the 1968 Olympics who were banished from the U.S. team and given 48 hours to get out of Mexico after raising their fists in the “black power” salute while “The Star Spangled Banner” was played during the medal ceremony. Former Cleveland Browns legend Jim Brown and NBA great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have also taken a stand with the 49er quarterback as they did with Muhammad Ali when he refused to be drafted into U.S. imperialism’s dirty war against Vietnamese workers and peasants.

Ali, who was stripped of his boxing title and livelihood, sharply linked U.S. imperialist war abroad to racial oppression at home:

“My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor, hungry people in the mud for big, powerful America. And shoot them for what? They never called me n‑‑‑‑r, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father.”

On September 1 in San Diego, Kaepernick again refused to stand for the national anthem, and this time was joined by teammate Eric Reid. But rather than remaining seated, they got down on one knee as “a way to show more respect for the men and women that fight for this country.” But the murderous repression of black people in the U.S. is more than matched by U.S. imperialism’s bloody wars overseas, from the A-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the millions of Vietnamese who were killed in the war against “godless Communism,” to the more recent wars, occupations and drone strikes against the peoples of the Near East.

As former Army Ranger Rory Fanning who did two tours in Afghanistan and is now part of #VeteransForKaepernick said in an interview with Jacobin (31 August):

“I have a difficult time standing for the national anthem. I entered the military fully expecting to be fighting for the cause of freedom and democracy, and trusting that I would be making the world safer after 9/11....

“The numbers alone show that the world is far more dangerous after fifteen years of endless American-led war. Since 9/11 we’ve also killed a million people, the vast majority civilians. We are killing brown people with impunity overseas, just like we are killing people of color with impunity here at home.”

Fanning served in the same unit as former NFL player Pat Tillman. Killed in 2004, Tillman was cynically made the poster boy for the warmongering George W. Bush administration, which promoted him as a heroic model of American patriotism who died at the hands of the “enemy.” In fact, Tillman, whose experience in Afghanistan led him to oppose the subsequent invasion of Iraq in 2003, was killed by “friendly fire.”

The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world where the national anthem is regularly played at domestic sports events, for the purpose of disappearing the class and racial divisions of society behind the myth of national unity and rallying the population behind American imperialism’s wars. That union members are also expected to stand for the national anthem or pledge of allegiance at their meetings is a savage indictment of the labor misleaders who have shackled the workers to the aims and interests of their capitalist exploiters. Gains won in hard-fought labor battles of the past have been sacrificed on the altar of patriotism, which is also wielded to pit workers against their class brothers and sisters abroad in the name of defending “American jobs.”

From the time of slavery, American capitalism has been rooted in the forcible subjugation of the black population at the bottom of society. “The Star Spangled Banner” was written by a Maryland slave owner, Francis Scott Key, who reviled blacks as “a distinct and inferior race of people, which all experience proves to be the greatest evil that afflicts a community.” Written during the War of 1812, its little known third stanza, which includes the line “no refuge could save the hireling and slave from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,” is a celebration of the killing of slaves who, promised their freedom, fought on the side of the British. Key was part of an inbred social caste of slaveowners and defenders of slavery. His sister married Roger Taney, the Supreme Court chief justice who authored the infamous 1857 Dred Scott ruling which declared that black people “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” The author of the national anthem would have been an opponent of the present U.S. Constitution as amended after slavery was smashed in the Civil War.

Frederick Douglass, a former slave and abolitionist leader, stripped bare the hypocrisy of America’s pretensions to freedom and democracy:

“What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.”

—“The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro” (July 1852)

It took a bloody Civil War, the Second American Revolution, to shatter the chains of chattel slavery. It will take a third American revolution—a proletarian socialist revolution—to break the chains of wage slavery and open the road to black freedom. The anthem of this fight will be the words of the “Internationale”: “No more tradition’s chains shall bind us; Arise, ye slaves no more in thrall! The earth shall rise on new foundations; We have been naught, we shall be all!”

5783,5ipo3o,CrazyGabey,1481911213.0,True,t3_5ipo3o,"tl;dr: I have documented proof of public corruption. The evidence shows that a district attorney, county judge, local attorney, and police department colluded together to destroy a 78-year old minister's life and place him behind bars.

* I just started a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CorruptClearfield/) for this project at the suggestion of another redditor.

In 2010, my 78-year old grandfather-in-law, John Gill, married a woman, Tara, nearly 30 years younger than him. His first wife passed away almost 20 years ago, and John believed he had once again found a companion to share his life with.

Soon after they married, the relationship took a maniacal turn.

Tara began dismantling John’s life brick-by-brick, culminating in an onslaught of false allegations of mental, emotional, and physical abuse. Her ultimate goal was obtaining a Protection from Abuse (PFA) restraining order. These orders are handed out like candy on Halloween in Pennsylvania, and they grant the accuser sole access to the legal residence, all marital property, and all financial assets. They deprive the accused of due process, and legally require just a 51% certainty that the allegations are true in order for a judge to rule in the accuser’s favor.

The allegations left John, a minister for over 50 years, penniless and with no legal recourse as he fought desperately to keep from being imprisoned.

John is the sixth man Tara has victimized in this manner.

If that wasn’t bad enough, my investigation into Tara’s allegations revealed collusion between the District Attorney’s office, a local police precinct, John’s former attorney, and a county judge. I also discovered forged evidence that was submitted by Tara, and later suppressed by the District Attorney’s office.

That “evidence” was used to incarcerate him, and he remains behind bars to this day.

EDIT: John was released early and unexpectedly on Monday, December 5th.

I confronted local government officials and was stonewalled, with most replying that they would not talk to me without an attorney present. I also contacted local media outlets, all of which claimed they were uninterested in the story. Out of options, I created this podcast in order to shine a light on deeds done in darkness.

You can listen to my 15-episode investigation by visiting [CorruptClearfield.com](http://fearthebeardmedia.com/category/corrupt-clearfield/) or by subscribing to ‘Corrupt Clearfield’ on iTunes, Google Play, or any other major podcast app.

Please share this podcast with everyone you know, and help our family by contacting the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office and asking them to investigate John’s case. A link to contact the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office can be found at [CorruptClearfield.com](http://fearthebeardmedia.com/category/corrupt-clearfield/).

You can view [all of the evidence sourced in this podcast series here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1ka268ck0lq6g88/AABJNBmbO6gW-qlABSUgC5F_a?dl=0). Most of these are the official court and police documents.

UPDATE:

40+ residents have reached out to share similar stories. I’ll be traveling to Clearfield in the near-future and conducting interviews with many of the folks who have reached out. My goal is to chronicle so many cases of misconduct that it becomes impossible for the state authorities to ignore. I’ve created Twitter and Facebook profiles specifically for this ongoing investigation, and anyone interested can follow along.

6213,3z8obo,NYPDconcernedcitizen,1451799607.0,True,t3_3z8obo,"**Let me preface this story by stating that, yes, I am bitter about receiving a $138 ticket from the NYPD. I will readily admit that I committed a traffic violation, but the NYPD's conduct on this front is exploitative, wrong, and lacking discretion.**


The NYPD is aware of a problem with directions provided by Google Maps, but still uses the situation to the city's financial advantage, rather than fixing the problem. Today, I received a traffic citation in Manhattan for an improper left turn from West 37th Street onto 9th Avenue. At that juncture, 9th Ave consists of four lanes. The left two lanes travel southbound towards the southern tip of Manhattan. The right two lanes access the Lincoln Tunnel. The pairs of lanes are separated by those short, skinny poles that you sometimes see in the road. At the southeast corner of the intersection, there is apparently a sign that says a vehicle is not permitted to turn left from 37th onto the right two lanes (i.e., Lincoln Tunnel access) of 9th Avenue. Google Maps did not know this, so it told me to make the turn, and I did (yes... I realize that I am still responsible for sign-watching even when following GPS directions... but most of my attention was focused on following directions and I simply missed the sign).


And that's when an NYPD officer, out of nowhere, walked into the middle of the street, waved me down, and yelled at me to pull over (in the middle of the street). So I pulled over. The officer asked for my ID and explained what I had done wrong. Not being from the area, I was completely confused by his explanation, but I wasn't going to argue considering I didn't know what I was talking about. I told the officer that I didn't understand, and he asked whether I was using a GPS. ""I was,"" I said. He responded, verbatim, ""Google Maps doesn't know signs around here. Happens all the time."" At this point, I apologized and thought that maybe he had made his point and I would be on my way.


Wrong. He wrote me a ticket, and stated that it would carry a *small* fine. When I asked what a small fine meant to him, he said $50. When I asked if there were any other fees involved, he said $88 (this is a ""mandatory surcharge"" according to the ticket). So, all in all, I'm out $138 for this mistake unless I'm willing to drive 6+ hours to challenge the ticket in court (which I'm not).


My problem with this whole situation is that the officer appeared all too comfortable and familiar with my mistake. Not only was he standing on the side of the road preying on this intersection, but he also already knew exactly how it happened (following GPS directions). Did I mention that he simultaneously pulled over and ticketed the car that followed me through the intersection?


Anyways, it irks me that the fines associated with this particular intersection are probably making the city tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars annually. The NYPD knows that GPS directions will lead out-of-towners to make this mistake, yet I'm sure that the NYPD has not done anything to make Google or other GPS providers aware of this particular problem. I know that [NYC recently reached out to Google](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/07/new-york-wants-google-maps-to-discourage-left-turns/398114/) in an effort to discourage drivers from making left turns in the city, but that effort seems tangentially, if at all, related to this situation.


TL;DR   I got a ticket for a weird improper left turn in Manhattan. An officer sits at this intersection to prey on out-of-towners who make the mistake. And the officer clearly knows that GPS directions will tell out-of-towners to make the turn. In turn, the city makes a ton of money, and I'm bitter that the NYPD probably won't do anything other than continuing to issue fines.",The NYPD exploits a known problem with Google Maps to its financial advantage.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3z8obo/the_nypd_exploits_a_known_problem_with_google/,2qqdb,0,2016-01-03 05:40:07,2016-01-03,05,reddit,0,-0.054904917845922045,-0.017099475919410443,-0.01845711122666966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ultimately, the blame lies with the kiler(s), but as far as who is responsible for bringing us to this place in our society - I hold 'The Blue Line' entirely and completely culpable. If citizens had a trust and belief that bad cops would be held accountable to the law - even cops who just act like assholes and bullies, then this wouldn't happen.

Every cop who has stood up for, or defended a fellow 'bully' cop should sleep with guilt and remorse tonight.

Also, shooting someone 5 times for not taking their hand out of their pocket should be considered murder. A police officer should never use deadly force unless it is in response to deadly force. Im sorry, but if that means once in a while a cautious cop is murdered, then that is the cost of duty.

On the 19th an off duty sheriff's deputy shot and killed a man in my city. He fled the scene but then called it in. I did a Google search on the deputy and found that he had shot someone in the past as well *and* that he has been moving around a lot between different agencies; several local police departments and 2 county sheriff's departments, all in the same area.  
I know that he can be a bad cop even with any thing showing up on his work history but I'd like to check any way. Do I need to do a FOIA request to see if he has been disciplined for past behavior? Is that the type of thing that would show in history or is that protected by police unions?

http://www.wftv.com/news/local/sheriff-off-duty-brevard-deputy-shoots-man-in-palm-bay-road-rage-incident/351386447

One thing they are not saying in this article is that the family was not allowed to see the victim. They did do an autopsy Monday but they still wont allow the family access. Nor are they talking to the family or answering any of their questions. They won't say whether the victim even had a gun. 

I would just like to know how to properly look into this LEOs background.
